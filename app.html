<!-- I just want to acknowledge up-front that I'm being a bit lazy in that this HTML is (almost) all generated by html_generator.py, which deals with line breaks in 
the input text by deleting them, and doesn't create bulleted lists; I feel like the learning / value of me demonstrating that I could build in those features is 
somewhat limited at this point, relative to the work it would take, and I REALLY didn't want to have to hand-code all of my notes into HTML.
Accordingly, I have nuked out my unit 1 notes, my footer, and my sweet image sidebar. I have also maintained the exact same CSS from project 1, and have not worried about
the fact that my HTML doesn't validate. Again, this is because the educational value of changing it is minimal relative to the work it would take to modify - I'll take pains
on my final project to make everything pretty and functional, but not here. Please also note my named, linked headers; I'm pretty proud of that. -->

				<h2 id = "Solving%20Problems">Solving Problems</h2>
					<p>Programming problems can be solved by breaking problems into smaller pieces, precisely and mechanically describing a series of steps that may be used to solve each piece, and those steps can be executed by a computer.</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class = "body">
				<h2 id = "Terminology">Terminology</h2>
					<p>Machines can only perform functions for which they were designed, and a computer is a machine that can do any computation. A program tells a computer what to do in a precise sequence of steps. A program written in a high-level language such as Python is interpreted by that language, and fed to the computer in a way the computer understands. A program's input is what it takes in, and its output is what results, an interpreter is a program that takes code as input, and outputs machine-readable instructions.</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class = "body">
				<h2 id = "Variables">Variables</h2>
					<p>A variable is a way of storing data. In Python data is stored (assigned) using the "=" symbol. Assignment is not math - it does something and assigns the data to the variable, it doesn't simply describe something that it true.</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class = "body">
				<h2 id = "Functions">Functions</h2>
					<p>A function is a mini-program. It takes input, does something with it, and generates output. Functions are useful because they are bits of code that may be re-used a number of times during your program without the need to re-write the code each time. Also, this allows following the DRY principle. With no return statement, a function evaluates to None in Python. You make a function with ""def", you use a function by calling it. In making a function, you have to be prepared for (theoretically) any input; when you call the function, you may know what input you are passing in. This makes the "assert" statement very useful to validate the type of data you are receiving.</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class = "body">
				<h2 id = "Control%20Flow%20and%20Loops">Control Flow and Loops</h2>
					<p>Allows the program to make decisions and selectively run certain pieces of code, either over and over, or not at all.</p>
			</div>
		
			<div class = "body">
				<h2 id = "Debugging">Debugging</h2>
					<p>We went over 5 debugging strategies in this lesson: (1) Examine error messages when programs crash: The last line of Python Tracebacks will tell you what went wrong. Reading backwards from there will tell you more about where the problem occurred.(2) Work from example code: If your modified code doesn't work, comment it out and do step-by-step modifications to the example code until it does what you want.(3) Make sure examples work: Just because you find example code doesn't mean it will work in your system. Check the example code you're using to make sure it behaves the way you expect.(4) Check (print) intermediate results: When your code doesn't crash, but doesn't behave as expected, add print statements to your program to see where in the code things stop behaving correctly.(5) Keep and compare old versions: When you have a working version of your code, save it before you add to the code. This will give you something to go back to if you introduce too many new bugs.</p>

				<h2 id = "Structured%20Data%20and%20For%20Loops">Structured Data and For Loops</h2>
					<p>(1) Mutation: change data in place, as opposed to creating a new object(2) Aliasing: when an object is assigned to more than one variable names, each variable name modifies that same object (i.e. the same object can have multiple names)(3) Structured data:  data which is held in objects that give the data structure -- eg. lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc.(4) Mutability: data that is mutable can be changed in-place, immutable data cannot be changed, and must be used in new objects.(5) The difference between append and +:  both add an item to create a different list - append mutates, and "+" creates a new list.</p>

				<h2 id = "How%20to%20Solve%20Problems">How to Solve Problems</h2>
					<p>First: make sure you understand the problem. The problem is defined by the relationship between the inputs and outputs -- eg. what goes in the black box? 1) DON'T PANIC 2) What are the inputs? (Defensive programming -- test to make sure assumptions are  [use "assert <expression>"; returns False if assertion fails]) 3) What are the outputs? 4) Work through examples by hand 4a) Create some test cases: give input as taken by the function, and the output, and build-in exceptions 4b) Understand how to solve the test cases in a systematic way, as a human 5) Begin creating a simple mechanical solution -- the necessity for fast code is determined by the expected use of the code (eg. number of times it will be run) 5a) Write PseudoCode -- don't start writing actual code until the code is (1) simple, and (2) handles almost all cases... there is a nexus between simplicity and cases that the code handles that must be reached before writing code. Simple == more likely to be correct 5b) Begin writing small bits of code with simplifications, and testing them as you go -- write the easy bits first, making assumptions as necessary (eg. assume each month has 30 days) 6) Develop the solution incrementally in small step</p>
					<!-- when I validate, I get the error: /p seen, but there were open elements; what does that mean? -->
